Slewing and handling of target offsets.

When a slew is performed all Offsets (OFFBY) are reset in the TCS to 0.0

We can have a target offset from Cat ra/dec of nominal source. 
This must be stored as it will be needed to add to catra/dec lwhen FITS headers 
are generated.

These offsets are passed to the SlewTask as the final ra/dec to slew to is 
calculated at the last moment by the CommandTranslator in the CIL Proxy layer 
- e.g. for moon etc.

Individual (temp) offsets are added via the OffsetTask. These must be stored so
as to be addded to nominal (or shifted) cat ra/dec in FITS headers.

These temp offsets are NON cumulative.

These offsets are performed due to:

 - POS_MosaicSetupMTA
 - POS_MosaicObserveMTA
 - TOCOffsetMTA
 - ObsSequenceMTA 
 - ObserveMTA.


Rules for updating FITS header stored params:

 ta:  Target Offset RA
 td:  Target Offset Dec

 da:  Temp offset RA
 dd:  Temp offset Dec

On Slew: 

 ta = target offset passed param
 td = target offset passed param

 da = 0.0
 dd = 0.0

On Offset:

 da = passed param
 dd = passed param


Rules for filling in FITS values for:
 
 RA    Inc temp offsets (i.e. ra + ta + da)
 CATRA What we send to TCS (i.e. ra + ta)
 APPRA

 DEC
 CATDEC What we send to TCS (i.e. DEC+td)
 APPDEC




Notes:

We add offsets directly and correct to 2pi and +/-pi - this only works
correctly for small offsets. ta/td could however be quite large

We do not handle ISS_OffsetRADEC as yet.

We do not consider drift due to NS tracking (e.g. moon).
