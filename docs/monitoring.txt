Spec for classes which perform monitoring of stuff...

-Create and configure the monitor at startup.

-Attach it to something which provides status to be monitored (eg Telescope.System monitoring)

-Set it going - it may very well be passive and just receives updates when the source flashes it.

-Provide a mechanism for interested parties to add and remove themselves as listeners for any alerts.

-Provide a mechanism to enable/disable the firing of alerts.A mechanism to allow the alert trigger to reset.

-A mechanism to trigger alerts. May include time period: eg - if status goes to x for at least n seconds

-Once an alert has been fired (to all registered parties) it should be disabled and not be able to fire again until reset.

-May want to set a flag to indicate to a recovery mode that something needs fixing .. an instance might be the AG
 If it goes to some state or is being refused by MCP as (not ready) we might do a AGSELECT and AGFOCUS before the next group
 either in Recovery mode via RCA or as part of science mode.

-RCA must reset the monitor via some setting so it does not keep triggering - ie we dont want to waste lots of time in recovery mode
 this might be a recording of how recently it triggered or how many triggers in last xxx time period.


-Sometimes the listener will want to further filter the trigger decision - eg an Ag Guide Lost might be ignored if this is
 a very short exposure or we are very near the end of a long exposure - cant see how this sort of decision can be made by
 the monitor it has to be the receiver's decision.



Things we might want to monitor.

-Tracking on each axis
-Autoguider lock
-Instrument offline/impairment

When in the occurance of a sequence should we start and stop monitoring ?

AG: ON     - When the AG is switched on with mandatory and succeeds. 
    IGNORE - When we switch on optional whether we succeed or not.
    OFF    - When we switch AG off (even if it wasnt switched on).

TRK: ON  - When we have completed a slew or rotate.
     OFF - When we either finish (tracking switched off) or
	   When another slew is attempted.
(note we may change over to a stop,trackoff,track on mentallity soon so this would be handy)

INST: ON - After we have configured an instrument.
      OFF - After we have totally done - ie axes are off again.
